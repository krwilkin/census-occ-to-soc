    "## Linking Census Occupation Codes with O\\*NET SOC Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook links occupation descriptions and task content descriptions from the Occupation Information Network (O\\*NET) to Census occupation codes and outputs to a `.json` format file. O\\*NET data are organized by the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, while Census uses its own coding regime based on the SOC. Many Census codes are aggregates of one or more SOC codes. This script uses the Census-SOC crosswalk to aggregate O\\*NET data to each Census code.\n",
    "\n",
    "O\\*NET data include a detailed description of each occupation as well as descriptions of the specific tasks which job analysts have determined are required to function within each occupation. In addition, they include sample job titles that fit into each occupation. If we assume that respondents are likely to write in their occupational title or describe what they do (tasks) for their occupation, then these data represent a collection of common occupation-specific terms that could be used by a NLP algorithm to train a model capable of predicting the occupation code for a given write-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this workbook is a `.json` file of Census occupation codes, a list of matched SOC codes from O\\*NET, a text string containing descriptions from each O\\*NET occupation input, a text string containing a description of all tasks associated with the Census code, and a text field comprising a comma-separated list of sample job titles. I chose to keep these fields separate so analysts could choose how or when to implement them indepdently, if at all. The JSON file is easily accessible using a standard text editor and it can be read into a `pandas` dataframe directly for use with the `nltk` in Python (at the end of this notebook I demonstrate how to read JSON into `pandas`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This file uses two inputs: (1) a Census-SOC crosswalk file obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau Web site and (2) a custom dictionary file taken from the O\\*NET API. Creation of the latter file is undertaken by the file `soc_work.py`."

    "The `json` format is essentially a list of dictionaries and each dictionary is a set of key-value pairs. If the data were organized in a tradtional rectangular data set, each dictionary (list element) would be a record, the keys would indicate a column title, and the value would be the datum for each column. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `xwalk` dictionary follows this format. However, the O\\*NET dictionary varies slightly. The set of sample occupations (indicated by the key `sample_of_reported_job_titles`) is organized as a list. Further, `tasks` are themselves a list of dictionary objects. In this regard, the `onet` JSON object may not be in \"true\" JSON format. The ability of JSON objects to store different types of information without an explicit schema is advantageous. \n",

    "The above illustration reveals several important details. First, with 507 Census occupations and 1,016 O\\*NET occupations, some aggregation will be necessary. Second, O\\*NET occupation codes include eight numeric digits (two following the decimal) while those referenced in the Census codes comprise only six. It is also worth noting that some Census occupations may have multiple SOC codes assigned to them (they will be in a space-delimited list; see the full file for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOC is a hierarchical system where the number of non-zero digits indicate nesting within a larger grouping. There are four levels of nesting: major, minor, broad, and detailed. The first two _non-zero_ digits indicate the \"major\" occupation group. For example, the 2018 SOC code 11-0000 refers to the \"Management Occupations\" major group. This major group nests all \"minor\" groups, which are indicated at the three-digit level (11-1000, 11-2000, 11-3000, and 11-9000). The broad group is characterized by the fifth digit being non-zero and the sixth digit being zero. For example, \"Top Executives\" are the broad group nested within the minor group 11-1000 and comprises occupation codes 11-1010, 11-1020, and 11-1030. Finally, the broad group nests \"detailed\" occupations, which have non-elements at the sixth digit. The broad group for \"Public Relations and Fundraising Managers\" (SOC 11-2030) nests detailed occupations \"Public Realations managers\" (SOC 11-2031) and \"Fundraising Managers\" (SOC 11-2033). More information about the SOC is available from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/soc). For our purposes, we use the 2018 SOC definitions, which will correspond to the ACS 2018 and 2019 data used in our capstone project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eight-digit SOC codes used by O\\*NET will follow the same nesting structure and should pose no problems for matching to Census occupation codes. Most O\\*NET occupation codes have .00 as their seventh and eight digits. Any non-zero digit at this level of detail will be nested to the sixth digit SOC as described above, while values of .00 are equivalent to six-digit codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the SOC hierarchy is critical for correctly matching O\\*NET data to Census codes. Many Census occupation codes will have a direct match to the SOC detailed occupations, such as \"Food Service Managers\" (Census code 0310 and SOC code 11-9051). Others refer to broad occupations and require aggregating information from detailed occupations in O\\*NET. For example, Census occupation code 0335 refers to \"Entertainment and Recreation Managers,\" which is the broad occupation group 11-9070 comprising detailed occupations 11-9071 and 11-9072.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps of this notebook use the SOC hierarchical structure to create a Census-code specific occupations \"documents\" by matching and, in some cases, aggregating information from O\\*NET descriptions of occupations, tasks, and sample occupations. To do this, I iterate over the set of Census occupation codes in `xwalk` and use the associated SOC code to select matching elements from O\\*NET. The information will be stored in a dictionary file that can be exported to JSON format for later use. O\\*NET descriptions, tasks, and job titles are stored in their own fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a first attempt at creating such a corpus. It may be decided upon later that omitting the sample job titles will be a good idea. Further, we may decided that adding sample occupations from the DTMF is desirable."
